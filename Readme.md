A C-based LISP interpreter
Overview

This project aims to create a simple implementation of a LISP language interpreter using C. Inspired by the book "Build Your Own Lisp," this project follows a step-by-step guide to building a minimalistic and interactive Lisp interpreter. The goal is to learn C by building a custom LISP interpreter from scratch.
Purpose

    Why build a Lisp?: Building a LISP interpreter helps you understand how languages work internally, including parsing, evaluation, error handling, and more.
    Why use C?: C provides a deep understanding of low-level programming concepts such as memory management, pointers, and direct interaction with the system.

Features

    Interactive Prompt: Supports reading, evaluating, and printing expressions.
    S-Expressions: Fully implements and evaluates LISPâ€™s fundamental data structure.
    Q-Expressions: Adding quoted expressions and macros for a more powerful language.
    Error Handling: Basic error handling for runtime issues.
    Minimal Standard Library: A few basic functions like list operations and mathematical functions.

Setup
Prerequisites

    C Compiler (GCC or Clang)
    Text Editor (VS Code, Sublime, or any editor you prefer)
    Make (optional, but helps automate the build process)
